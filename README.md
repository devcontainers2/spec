## Development

To get started, make sure you have [Bikeshed] installed, then run these commands
in **two separate terminals** (so that they're running simultaneously):

```sh
bikeshed watch
python -m http.server
```

<sup>If you're on Linux you can use the `&` operator</sup>

In VS Code you can click the <kbd>[|]</kbd> button in the terminal to split it
into two.

â„¹ Bikeshed supports all of CommonMark, but not GFM. For instance, [tables must be
HTML `<table>` elements] instead of `|`-delimited Markdown tables. But don't let
that fool you! It's auto-linking features _vastly_ surpass plain Markdown. Make
sure you use `[=hello=]` to autolink to `<dfn>hello</dfn>`!

If you want to add a big text minimap marker, do this:

```html
<!-- Big Text: My new section -->

# My new section
```

```sh
bikeshed source --big-text
```
