# Development Containers

This repository is for the Development Container Specification.

A development container allows you to use a container as a full-featured
development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate
tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in
continuous integration and testing.

The Development Containers Specification seeks to find ways to enrich existing
formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration
while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option – so
that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and
testing.

The first format in the specification, `devcontainer.json`, was born out of
necessity. It is a structured JSON with Comments (jsonc) metadata format that
tools can use to store any needed configuration required to develop inside of
local or cloud-based containerized coding.

We envision that this same structured data can be embedded in images and other
formats – all while retaining a common object model for consistent processing.
For example, some of this same metadata can be added to a
`devcontainer.metadata` image label to tie settings directly to a container
image.

Beyond repeatable setup, these same development containers provide consistency
to avoid environment specific problems across developers and centralized build
and test automation services. You can use the
[open-source CLI reference implementation](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli)
either directly or integrated into product experiences to use the structured
metadata to deliver these benefits. It currently supports integrating with
Docker Compose and a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option – so
that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and
testing.

A GitHub Action and an Azure DevOps Task are available in
[devcontainers/ci](https://github.com/devcontainers/ci) for running a
repository's dev container in continuous integration (CI) builds. This allows
you to reuse the same setup that you are using for local development to also
build and test your code in CI.

## Development

To get started, make sure you have [Bikeshed] installed, then run these commands
in **two separate terminals**:

```sh
bikeshed watch
python -m http.server 8000
```

In VS Code you can click the <kbd>[|]</kbd> button in the terminal to split it
into two.

ℹ Bikeshed supports all of CommonMark, but not GFM. For instance, [table must be
HTML `<table>` elements] instead of `|`-delimited Markdown tables. But don't let
that fool you! It's auto-linking features _vastly_ surpass plain Markdown. Make
sure you use `[=hello=]` to autolink to `<dfn>hello</dfn>`!
